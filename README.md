# Preparing for Influenza Season
# Motivation
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
staff.
# Objective
Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
# Data Limitations
Both data sets are sourced from reliable government agencies and are considered trustworthy. 
However, it is important to keep some limitations in mind that are listed below:
The Influenza deaths data was collected by death certificates. Death certificates only list one 
cause of death which could be prone to inconsistencies for patients with preexisting conditions 
such as cancer or heart disease that may have contributed to their deaths. 
The census data is collected once every 10 years by the US Census Bureau. This fact means that 
we are relying on figures that are estimates rather than hard data. The census data is also 
collected manually which leaves it prone to error.
