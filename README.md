# Motivation
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
staff.
# Objective
Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
